# svgwebdemo
Sample repo to showcase linters, unittests and automatic publishing

SVG load via fetch is not working if you open it from the file system!

if you have phyton installed it is easy to start a webserver in the repo:

`python -m http.server 8000`

Allowing you to test via http://localhost:8000/
